       " {'abstract': 'Bacillus subtilis ferrochelatase is encoded by the hemH gene of the hemEHY gene cluster and catalyses the incorporation of Fe2+ into protoporphyrin IX. B. subtilis ferrochelatase produced in Escherichia coli was purified. It was found to be a monomeric, water-soluble enzyme of molecular mass 35 kDa which in addition to Fe2+ can incorporate Zn2+ and Cu2+ into protoporphyrin IX. Chemical modification experiments indicated that the single cysteine residue in the ferrochelatase is required for enzyme activity although it is not a conserved residue compared to other ferrochelatases. In growing B. subtilis, the ferrochelatase constitutes approximately 0.05% (by mass) of the total cell protein, which corresponds to some 600 ferrochelatase molecules/cell. The turnover number of isolated ferrochelatase, 18-29 min-1, was found to be consistent with the rate of haem synthesis in exponentially growing cells (0.2 mol haem formed/min/mol enzyme). It is concluded that the B. subtilis ferrochelatase has enzymic properties which are similar to those of other characterised ferrochelatases of known primary structure, i.e. ferrochelatases of the mitochondrial inner membrane of yeast and mammalian cells. However, in contrast to these enzymes the B. subtilis enzyme is a water-soluble protein and should be more amenable to structural analysis.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The mitogenic effect of extracellular ATP was examined in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). ATP, 2-methylthio-ATP, and ADP stimulated [3H]thymidine and [3H]leucine incorporation and cell growth. AMP, adenosine, UTP, and P2x agonists showed little of these effects. Reactive blue 2, a P2Y purinoceptor antagonist, was effective in suppressing the mitogenic effect of ATP and 2-methylthio-ATP, indicating that extracellular ATP-induced VSMC proliferation is mediated by P2Y purinoceptors. The P2Y purinoceptor activation was coupled to a pertussis toxin (PTX)-insensitive G protein (Gq) and triggered phosphoinositide hydrolysis with subsequent activation of protein kinase C (PKC), Raf-1, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in VSMCs. In response to ATP, both 42-and 44-kDa MAPKs were activated, and tyrosine was phosphorylated. Western blot analysis using PKC isozyme-specific antibodies indicated that VSMCs express PKC-alpha, PKC-delta, and PKC-zeta. A complete down-regulation of PKC-alpha and PKC-delta was seen after 24-hr treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. When cells were pretreated with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate for 24 hr and subsequently challenged with ATP, Raf-1 activation and 42-kDa as well as 44-kDa MAPK tyrosine phosphorylation failed to be induced. These results demonstrate that ATP-induced Raf-1 and MAPK activations involve the activation of PKC-alpha and PKC-delta. P2Y purinoceptor stimulation with ATP also caused accumulation of c-fos and c-myc mRNAs. Both Reactive blue 2 and staurosporine significantly blocked this increase by ATP. In conclusion, the mitogenic effect of ATP seemed to be triggered by activation of the Gq protein-coupled P2Y purinoceptor that led to the formation of inositol trisphosphate and activation of PKC. PKC and, in turn, Raf-1 and MAPK were then activated, leading eventually to DNA synthesis and cell proliferation.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'In this work we have microdissected lamina propria plasma cells and used polymerase chain reaction and sequencing to investigate immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangements and mutations in human intestine. In addition, specific primers were designed for individual Ig gene rearrangements to analyze the distribution of related B cell and plasma cell clones at different sites along the bowel. Confirming our earlier work, intestinal IgVH genes were highly mutated in plasma cells from older individuals (> 30 years). IgVH genes were significantly less mutated in samples taken from patients aged 11-30 years, and there were fewer mutations again in samples from young children (< 11 years). In age-matched specimens the number of mutations was equivalent in the duodenum and colon. Using complementarity-determining region 3 primers to amplify specific Ig gene rearrangements, evidence was also found for the existence of related lamina propria plasma cells along the small bowel and colon, although these were quite scarce. In addition, analysis of the numbers of related clones in a random sampling from discrete areas of lamina propria indicates that the local population is diverse. These results suggest that the highly mutated IgVH genes in adult intestinal plasma cells are a consequence of chronic antigen exposure with age. Duodenal plasma cells are as highly mutated as colonic plasma cells, despite the fact that the upper bowel has no indigenous microbial flora (the stimulus for intestinal plasma cells). They also show that the plasma cell population is diverse and can be widely disseminated along the bowel.',\n",

In a randomized, prospective study, patients undergoing routine elective coronary artery bypass grafting were managed with either early or late tracheal extubation. The incidence and severity of electrocardiographic myocardial ischaemia were compared. Data were analysed from 85 patients (43 early extubation; 42 late extubation). Median time to extubation was 110 min in the early extubation patients and 757 min in the late extubation patients. After correction for randomization bias, there were no significant differences between groups in ischaemic burden, maximal ST-segment deviation, incidence of ischaemia and area under the ST deviation-time curve (integral of ST deviation and time). Similarly, there were no differences between groups in postoperative creatine kinase MB-isoenzyme concentrations and duration of stay in the ICU or hospital. Therefore, this study provides evidence for the safety of early extubation after routine coronary artery bypass grafting.',\n",

Entrapment of the cauda equina roots by hypertrophy of the osseous and soft tissue structures surrounding the lumbar spinal canal is often associated with incapacitating pain in the back and lower extremities, difficulty ambulating, leg paresthesias and weakness and, in severe cases, bowel or bladder disturbances. The characteristic syndrome associated with lumbar stenosis is termed neurogenic intermittent claudication. This condition must be differentiated from true claudication, which is caused by atherosclerosis of the pelvofemoral vessels. Although many conditions may be associated with lumbar canal stenosis, most cases are idiopathic. Imaging of the lumbar spine performed with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging often demonstrates narrowing of the lumbar canal with compression of the cauda equina nerve roots by thickened posterior vertebral elements, facet joints, marginal osteophytes or soft tissue structures such as the ligamentum flavum or herniated discs. Treatment for symptomatic lumbar stenosis is usually surgical decompression. Medical treatment alternatives, such as bed rest, pain management and physical therapy, should be reserved for use in debilitated patients or patients whose surgical risk is prohibitive as a result of concomitant medical conditions.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'As a collaborative research project of the Committees for the Study of Idiopathic Cardiomyopathy, a questionnaire was sent out to 19 medical institutions in Japan in order to examine the possible association between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and cardiomyopathies. Hepatitis C virus antibody was found in 74 of 697 patients (10.6%) with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (mean age, 57.7 years) and in 42 of 663 patients (6.3%) with dilated cardiomyopathy (mean age, 56.5 years); these prevalences were significantly higher than that found in volunteer blood donors in Japan (2.4%, 50-59 years of age, each p<0.0001). The prevalence was significantly higher in patients suffering from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as opposed to those with dilated cardiomyopathy (p<0.01). The presence of HCV antibody was detected in 650 of 11,967 patients (5.4%) patients seeking care in 5 academic hospitals. Various cardiac abnormalities were found among these patients, arrhythmias being the most frequent. These observations suggest that HCV infection is an important cause of a variety of otherwise unexplained heart diseases.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Today, sepsis syndrome is the leading cause of death in adult, non-coronary intensive care units (ICUs) and is of great clinical importance. The purpose of this review was to evaluate recent prospective studies concerning the short- and long-term prognosis of patients suffering from systemic inflammatory-response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock. It has been shown in multicentre prospective surveys that 1% and 0.3% of all patients admitted to hospitals suffer, respectively, from bacteraemia alone and bacteraemia with severe sepsis. This rate increases, of course, when only admissions to the ICUs are considered: the above-mentioned rates increase then by a factor of 8 and 30, respectively. Thus, approximately 10% of patients in the ICU suffer from sepsis, 6% from severe sepsis and 2-3% from septic shock. SIRS occurs more frequently and its occurrence ranges from 40% to 70% of all patients admitted to ICUs. Thereby, 40-70% suffering from SIRS progress to a more severe septic-disease state. The overall prognosis is still poor, despite the recent advances in ICU treatment. The mortality rate of SIRS ranges from 6% to 7% and in septic shock amounts to over 50%. In particular, abdominal sepsis exhibits the highest mortality rate with 72%. The long-term prognosis is equally poor; only approximately 30% survived the first year after hospital admission.',\n",

Systematic studies on the effects of SSRIs on cardiac function are scarce, despite the high prevalence of cardiac disorders in the older depressed patient. This is a study which systematically assessed cardiac function by echocardiography in middle-aged and elderly depressed patients treated with SSRI. In a double-blind randomized trial, 20 patients were assigned to receive fluvoxamine 100 mg/day [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] or fluoxetine 20 mg/day [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] for 6 weeks. Cardiac function was assessed by left ventricle ejection fraction, aortic flow integral and early or passive/late or active mitral inflow, and electrocardiography. Neither SSRI significantly affected cardiac function. Compared with patients without a history of myocardial infarction and/or hypertension, patients with such a history showed a significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction. Despite our small study sample, these data indicate that both fluoxetine and fluvoxamine do not affect cardiac function adversely.\",\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Systemic injections of cholecystokinin (CCK), a \"gut-brain\" peptide, have been shown to modulate brain dopamine function and produce neuroleptic-like effects on such dopamine-regulated behaviors as locomotor activity. However, clinical trials of CCK agonists in schizophrenia patients showed mixed results. To re-examine the antipsychotic potential of CCK-based treatments, we examined systemic injections of CCK analogs in an animal model with strong face and construct validity for sensorimotor-gating deficits seen in schizophrenia patients and with strong predictive validity for antipsychotic drug activity. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) occurs when a weak acoustic lead stimulus (\"prepulse\") inhibits the startle response to a sudden loud sound (\"pulse\"). PPI is significantly reduced in schizophrenia patients and rats treated with dopamine agonists. Antipsychotics reverse decreased PPI in rats to a degree highly correlated with their clinical efficacy. Subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of caerulein (10 micrograms/kg) a mixed CCKA/B agonist, partially reversed amphetamine-induced reduction of PPI; whereas, s.c. haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg) totally reversed amphetamine-induced disruption of PPI. Caerulein\\'s effect on PPI was blocked by pretreatment with a CCKA antagonist (devazepide) but not a CCKB antagonist (L-365,260). CCK-4, a preferential CCKB agonist, had no significant effect on PPI. These results suggest that caerulein produces a weak neuroleptic-like effect on PPI that is mediated by stimulation of CCKA receptors. Possible circuities in this effect are discussed. In a separate experiment, s.c. caerulein produced to a more potent neuroleptic-like profile on amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion, suggesting that selection of preclinical paradigms may be important in evaluating the antipsychotic potential of CCK-based treatments.',\n",

Although the growth temperatures of the mesophiles are about 50 degrees C below that of M. jannaschii, their genomic G+C contents are nearly identical. The properties most correlated with the proteins of the thermophile include higher residue volume, higher residue hydrophobicity, more charged amino acids (especially Glu, Arg, and Lys), and fewer uncharged polar residues (Ser, Thr, Asn, and Gln). These are recurring themes, with all trends applying to 83-92% of the proteins for which complete sequences were available. Nearly all of the amino acid replacements most significantly correlated with the temperature change are the same relatively conservative changes observed in all proteins, but in the case of the mesophile/thermophile comparison there is a directional bias. We identify 26 specific pairs of amino acids with a statistically significant (P < 0.01) preferred direction of replacement.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The nirIX gene cluster of Paracoccus denitrificans is located between the nir and nor gene clusters encoding nitrite and nitric oxide reductases respectively. The NirI sequence corresponds to that of a membrane-bound protein with six transmembrane helices, a large periplasmic domain and cysteine-rich cytoplasmic domains that resemble the binding sites of [4Fe-4S] clusters in many ferredoxin-like proteins. NirX is soluble and apparently located in the periplasm, as judged by the predicted signal sequence. NirI and NirX are homologues of NosR and NosX, proteins involved in regulation of the expression of the nos gene cluster encoding nitrous oxide reductase in Pseudomonas stutzeri and Sinorhizobium meliloti. Analysis of a NirI-deficient mutant strain revealed that NirI is involved in transcription activation of the nir gene cluster in response to oxygen limitation and the presence of N-oxides. The NirX-deficient mutant transiently accumulated nitrite in the growth medium, but it had a final growth yield similar to that of the wild type. Transcription of the nirIX gene cluster itself was controlled by NNR, a member of the family of FNR-like transcriptional activators. An NNR binding sequence is located in the middle of the intergenic region between the nirI and nirS genes with its centre located at position -41.5 relative to the transcription start sites of both genes. Attempts to complement the NirI mutation via cloning of the nirIX gene cluster on a broad-host-range vector were unsuccessful, the ability to express nitrite reductase being restored only when the nirIX gene cluster was reintegrated into the chromosome of the NirI-deficient mutant via homologous recombination in such a way that the wild-type nirI gene was present directly upstream of the nir operon.',\n",

Promoter elements in the 5 kb upstream of the translation start were identified using adult retinal pigment epithelium cells (ARPE-19) as a model system. A 160 bp minimal promoter within the first intron was active in ARPE-19 cells, but not in HeLa cells that do not express MYO7A. A 100 bp sequence, 5' of the first exon, and repeated with 90% homology within the first intron, appeared to modulate expression in both cell lines. Segments containing these elements were screened by heteroduplex analysis. No heteroduplexes were detected in the minimal promoter, suggesting that this sequence is conserved. A -2568 A>T transversion in the 5' 100 bp repeat, eliminating a CCAAT element, was found only in USH1B patients. However, in all 5 families, -2568 A>T was in cis with the same missense mutation in the myosin VIIa tail (Arg1240Gln), and 4 of the 5 families were Dutch. These observations suggest either 1) linkage disequilibrium or 2)that a combination of a promoter mutation with a less active myosin VIIa protein results in USH1B.\",\n",

On endosonography, the duodenal IFP appeared as a coarsely heterogeneous isoechoic and hypoechoic mass circumscribed by a distinct margin and arising from the third layer of the duodenal wall. The endosonographic appearance of this lesion was in marked contrast to that previously reported for gastric IFPs, which have tended to appear as hypoechoic homogeneous lesions with indistinct margins. Endosonographic evaluation of suspected IFPs before endoscopic or surgical treatment is useful. However, the endosonographic appearances of duodenal and gastric IFPs may be significantly different, possibly because of differences in the makeup of the duodenal and gastric walls.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Germline mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 predispose to hereditary breast, ovarian, and possibly prostate cancer, yet structural mutations in these genes are infrequent in sporadic cancer cases. To better define the involvement of these genes in sporadic cancers, we characterized expression levels of BRCA1 and BRCA2 transcripts in cancer cell lines derived from neoplasms of the ovary, prostate, and breast and compared them with those expressed in primary cultures of normal epithelial cells established from these organs. We observed upregulation of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 expression in six of seven ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCA420, OVCA429, OVCA432, ALST, DOV13, and SKOV3) when compared with levels found in normal ovary surface epithelial cells. Furthermore, five cancerous or immortalized prostatic epithelial cell lines (BPH-1, TSU-Pr1, LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145) also expressed higher levels of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mRNA than did primary cultures of normal prostatic epithelial cells. In contrast, only the estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cell line overexpressed these messages, whereas the estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cell lines Hs578T, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 showed no change in expression levels when compared with normal breast epithelial cells. In addition, expanding on our recent identification of a novel BRCA2 transcript variant carrying an in-frame exon 12 deletion (BRCA2 delta 12), we report increased expression of this variant in several ovarian, prostate, and mammary cancer cell lines (OVCA420, OVCA433, ALST, DOV13, SKOV3, TSU-Pr1, DU145, and MDA-MB-468). Most notably, high levels of BRCA2 delta 12 mRNA were detected in an estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, and in an androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line, DU-145. Interestingly, the wild-type BRCA2 transcript was barely detectable in DU145, which could be used as a model system for future investigations on BRCA2 delta 12 function. Taken together, our data suggest disruption of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 gene expression in certain epithelial cancer cell lines of the ovary, prostate, and breast. Because wild-type BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene products increase during cell-cycle progression and are believed to exert growth-inhibitory action, enhanced expression of these genes in cancer cells may represent a negative feedback mechanism for curbing proliferation in fast-growing cells. At present, the functionality of BRCA2 delta 12 remains elusive.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Increasing evidence suggests that a continuous release of histamine from mast cells occurs in the airways of asthmatic patients and that histamine may modulate functions of other inflammatory cells such as macrophages. In the present study histamine (10(-9)-10(-6) M) increased in a concentration-dependent fashion the basal release of beta-glucuronidase (EC(50) = 8.2 +/- 3.5 x 10(-9) M) and IL-6 (EC(50) = 9.3 +/- 2.9 x 10(-8) M) from human lung macrophages. Enhancement of beta-glucuronidase release induced by histamine was evident after 30 min and peaked at 90 min, whereas that of IL-6 required 2-6 h of incubation. These effects were reproduced by the H(1) agonist (6-[2-(4-imidazolyl)ethylamino]-N-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)heptane carboxamide but not by the H(2) agonist dimaprit. Furthermore, histamine induced a concentration-dependent increase of intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) that followed three types of response, one characterized by a rapid increase, a second in which [Ca(2+)](i) displays a slow but progressive increase, and a third characterized by an oscillatory pattern. Histamine-induced beta-glucuronidase and IL-6 release and [Ca(2+)](i) elevation were inhibited by the selective H(1) antagonist fexofenadine (10(-7)-10(-4) M), but not by the H(2) antagonist ranitidine. Inhibition of histamine-induced beta-glucuronidase and IL-6 release by fexofenadine was concentration dependent and displayed the characteristics of a competitive antagonism (K(d) = 89 nM). These data demonstrate that histamine induces exocytosis and IL-6 production from human macrophages by activating H(1) receptor and by increasing [Ca(2+)](i) and they suggest that histamine may play a relevant role in the long-term sustainment of allergic inflammation in the airways.',\n",

       " {'abstract': \"Increasingly more aggressive chemotherapy together with expected small differences between treatments with respect to objective endpoints has heightened awareness about the importance of addressing how patients experience and value the impact that treatment has had on their overall life situation. Assessment of a patient's quality of life (QoL) is now conceptually viewed as an important complement to traditional objective evaluation measures. It was therefore considered important to review the basis for the assessment of this endpoint when The Swedish Council of Technology Assessment in Health Care (SBU) performed a systematic overview of chemotherapy effects in several tumour types. The group came to the following conclusions: QoL assessments, mostly by patient self-reporting in questionnaires, have come increasingly into use during the past decade. A number of general, cancer-specific and cancer diagnosis-specific instruments have been developed. There is at present little need for development of new cancer instruments, although specific treatment modalities and tumour types may need new additional modules. A predefined hypothesis should determine the instrument to be used. Since the selection of a QoL instrument in a specific study influences both the results and the conclusions, it is essential to carefully select the instrument or instruments that have the greatest likelihood of identifying relevant differences between treatment alternatives. Interpretation of QoL data is more difficult than interpretation of objective endpoints such as survival time, objective response rates or toxicity. Despite these difficulties, QoL analyses have provided new insights into the advantages and disadvantages of various treatments not provided by traditional end-points. Some palliative treatments seemingly increase patients' QoL despite side-effects or the lack of, or marginal, increases in survival. When using potentially curative chemotherapy, it is not a matter of when the treatment should be started, but rather when it should be concluded. When using less active chemotherapy, the expected small therapeutic gains must be weighed against the QoL costs of using the therapy: does the toxicity and/or the inconvenience of the proposed treatment justify the expected gain? When it is found that the strain on the patient is greater than the effects of the cancer, treatment must be discontinued. It is not possible to determine whether or not the advantages of palliative chemotherapy are worth their costs without knowledge about patients' personal values regarding the influence on factors of relevance for QoL. The mostly used QoL questionnaires do not consider individual preferences, which therefore need to be addressed in the dialogue with the patient. QoL assessment is clearly in need of further methodological improvement before this endpoint can be regarded as fully established with respect to ability to provide unequivocally useful data in clinical trials. The multitude of questionnaires, missing data, lack of pre-study hypotheses of relevant differences between treatments and data multiplicity giving a risk for chance findings are examples of serious methodological problems. Patient response-shifts over time further complicate the interpretation of the data. Thus, QoL data, also from seemingly well-performed clinical trials, have to be interpreted cautiously. The international development during recent years has aimed at creating increased standardization of QoL measures. This has created greater possibilities to compare results from different trials. Hopefully, this also implies that it will be possible to draw firmer conclusions from QoL measurements in recently completed or ongoing trials than has been the case previously. QoL assessments are resource demanding even when short standardized questionnaires are used. Since cancer patients also generally give priority to anticancer effects over toxicity and convenience, QoL assessments in clinical trials are motivated mainly in study settings comparing treatments without expected major differences of outcome in objective endpoints.\",\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Textured implant surfaces are thought to enhance endosseous integration. Torque removal forces have been used as a biomechanical measure of anchorage, or endosseous integration, in which the greater forces required to remove implants may be interpreted as an increase in the strength of bony integration. The purpose of this study was to compare the torque resistance to removal of screw-shaped titanium implants having a dual acid-etched surface (Osseotite) with implants having either a machined surface, or a titanium plasma spray surface that exhibited a significantly more complex surface topography. Three custom screw-shaped implant types - machined, dual acid-etched (DAE), and titanium plasma sprayed (TPS) - were used in this study. Each implant surface was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and optical profilometry. One DAE implant was placed into each distal femur of eighteen adult New Zealand White rabbits along with one of the other implant types. Thus, each rabbit received two DAE implants and one each of the machined, or TPS, implants. All implants measured 3.25 mm in diameter x 4.00 mm in length without holes, grooves or slots to resist rotation. Eighteen rabbits were used for reverse torque measurements. Groups of six rabbits were sacrificed following one, two and three month healing periods. Implants were removed by reverse torque rotation with a digital torque-measuring device. Three implants with the machined surface preparation failed to achieve endosseous integration. All other implants were anchored by bone. Mean torque values for machined, DAE and TPS implants at one, two and three months were 6.00+/-0.64 N-cm, 9.07+/-0.67 N-cm and 6.73+/-0.95 N-cm; 21.86+/-1.37 N-cm, 27.63+/-3.41 N-cm and 27.40+/-3.89 N-cm; and 27.48+/-1.61 N-cm, 44.28+/-4.53 N-cm and 59.23+/-3.88 N-cm, respectively. Clearly, at the earliest time point the stability of DAE implants was comparable to that of TPS implants, while that of the machined implants was an order of magnitude lower. The TPS implants increased resistance to reverse torque removal over the three-month period. The results of this study confirm our previous results that demonstrated enhanced bony anchorage to dual acid-etched implants as compared to machined implants. Furthermore, the present results indicate that dual acid etching of titanium enhances early endosseous integration to a level which is comparable to that achieved by the topographically more complex TPS surfaces.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Porous beta-phase tricalcium phosphate particles (pTCP) (Cerasorb) were used in two patients to restore or augment alveolar bone prior to the placement of dental implants. In one patient, pTCP was used to fill a large alveolar defect in the posterior mandible after the removal of a residual cyst, and in another patient to augment the sinus floor. Biopsies were taken at the time of implant placement, 9.5 and 8 months after grafting, respectively, and processed for hard tissue histology. Goldner-stained histological sections showed considerable replacement of the bone substitute by bone and bone marrow. In the 9.5 months biopsy of the mandible, 34% of the biopsy consisted of mineralised bone tissue and 29% of remaining pTCP, while the biopsy at 8 months after sinus floor augmentation consisted of 20% mineralised bone and 44% remaining pTCP. Bone and osteoid were lying in close contact with the remaining pTCP and were also seen within the micropores of the grafted particles. Tartrate resistant-acid phosphatase (TRAP) multinuclear cells, presumably osteoclasts, were found surrounding, within and in close contact with the pTCP particles, suggesting active resorption of the bone substitute. Remodelling of immature woven bone into mature lamellar bone was also found. No histological signs of inflammation were detected. The limited data presented from these two cases suggest that this graft material, possibly by virtue of its porosity and chemical nature, may be a suitable bone substitute that can biodegrade and be replaced by new mineralising bone tissue.',\n",

We found it possible to add an amino group on the aromatic moiety of our reported 1-[(1-acyl-4-piperidyl)methyl]-1H-2-methylimidazo[4,5-c]pyridine derivatives or on British Biotech compounds BB-882 and BB-823 maintaining a high level of activity as PAF antagonist. A selected compound UR-12715 (49c) showed an IC(50) of 8 nM in the in vitro PAF-induced aggregation assay, and an ID(50) of 29 microg/kg in the in vivo PAF-induced hypotension test in normotensive rats. Through attachment of 49c to the 5-ASA via azo functionality we obtained UR-12746 (70). Pharmacokinetics experiments with [14C]-70 allow us to reach the following conclusions, critical in the design of these new prodrugs of 5-ASA. Neither the whole molecule 70 nor the carrier 49c were absorbed after oral administration of [14C]-70 in rat as was demonstrated by the absence of plasma levels of radioactivity and the high recovery of it in feces. Effective cleavage of azo bond (84%) by microflora in the colon is achieved. These facts ensure high topical concentrations of 5-ASA and 49c in the colon. Additionally, 70 exhibited a potent anticolitic effect in the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced colitis model in the rat. This profile suggests that UR-12746 (70) provides an attractive new approach to the treatment of ulcerative colitis.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'We have used the highly selective alpha(4)beta(1) inhibitor 2S-[(1-benzenesulfonyl-pyrrolidine-2S-carbonyl)-amino]-4-[4-methyl-2S-(methyl-[2-[4-(3-o-tolyl-ureido)-phenyl]-acetyl]-amino)-pentanoylamino]-butyric acid (BIO7662) as a model ligand to study alpha(4)beta(1) integrin-ligand interactions on Jurkat cells. Binding of [(35)S]BIO7662 to Jurkat cells was dependent on the presence of divalent cations and could be blocked by treatment with an excess of unlabeled inhibitor or with EDTA. K(D) values for the binding of BIO7662 to Mn(2+)-activated alpha(4)beta(1) and to the nonactivated state of the integrin that exists in 1 mm Mg(2+), 1 mm Ca(2+) were <10 pm, indicating that it has a high affinity for both activated and nonactivated integrin. No binding was observed on alpha(4)beta(1) negative cells. Through an analysis of the metal ion dependences of ligand binding, several unexpected findings about alpha(4)beta(1) function were made. First, we observed that Ca(2+) binding to alpha(4)beta(1) was stimulated by the addition of BIO7662. From solution binding studies on purified alpha(4)beta(1), two types of Ca(2+)-binding sites were identified, one dependent upon and the other independent of BIO7662 binding. Second, we observed that the metal ion dependence of ligand binding was affected by the affinity of the ligand for alpha(4)beta(1). ED(50) values for the metal ion dependence of the binding of BIO7762 and the binding of a lower affinity ligand, BIO1211, differed by 2-fold for Mn(2+), 30-fold for Mg(2+), and >1000-fold for Ca(2+). Low Ca(2+) (ED(50) = 5-10 microm) stimulated the binding of BIO7662 to alpha(4)beta(1). The effects of microm Ca(2+) closely resembled the effects of Mn(2+) on alpha(4)beta(1) function. Third, we observed that the rate of BIO7662 binding was dependent on the metal ion concentration and that the ED(50) for the metal ion dependence of BIO7662 binding was affected by the concentration of the BIO7662. These studies point to an even more complex interplay between metal ion and ligand binding than previously appreciated and provide evidence for a three-component coupled equilibrium model for metal ion-dependent binding of ligands to alpha(4)beta(1).',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Marfan syndrome (MFS), an autosomal dominant disorder of the extracellular matrix, is due to mutations in fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene. Investigations carried out in the last decade, unveiled the unpredictability of the site of the mutation, which could be anywhere in the gene. FBN1 mutations have been reported in a spectrum of diseases related to MFS, with no clear evidence for a phenotype-genotype correlation. In this paper we analysed 10 British patients affected by MFS and we were able to characterise five novel missense mutations (C474W, C1402Y, G1987R, C2153Y, G2536R), one novel frameshift mutation (7926delC), one already described mutation (P1424A) and one FBN1 variant (P1148A) classified as a polymorphism in the Asian population. Four out of the five novel missense mutations involved either cysteines or an amino acid conserved in the domain structure. The mutation yield in this study is calculated at 80.0% (8/10), thus indicating that SSCA is a reliable and cost-effective technique for the screening of such a large gene. Our results suggest that this method is reliable to search for FBN1 mutations and that FBN1 screening could be a helpful tool to confirm and possibly anticipate the clinical diagnosis in familial cases.

We measured cytoplasmic free calcium in protoplasts isolated from the elongation zone and cap of primary roots of light-grown, vertically oriented seedlings of Zea mays L. Protoplasts were loaded with the penta-potassium salts of fura-2 and indo-1 by incubation in acidic solutions of these calcium indicators. Loading increased with decreasing pH but the pH dependence was stronger for indo-1 than for fura-2. In the case of fura-2, loading was enhanced only at the lowest pH (4.5) tested. Dyes loaded in this manner were distributed predominantly in the cytoplasm as indicated by fluorescence patterns. As an alternative method of loading, protoplasts were incubated with the acetoxymethylesters of fura-2 and indo-1. Protoplasts loaded by this method exhibited fluorescence both in the cytoplasm and in association with various organelles. Cytoplasmic calcium levels measured using spectrofluorometry, were found to be 160 +/- 40 nM and 257 +/- 27 nM, respectively, in populations of protoplasts from the root cap and elongation zone. Cytoplasmic free calcium did not increase upon addition of calcium to the incubation medium, indicating that the passive permeability to calcium was low.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The genetic profile of Palestinians has, for the first time, been studied by using human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene variability and haplotypes. The comparison with other Mediterranean populations by using neighbor-joining dendrograms and correspondence analyses reveal that Palestinians are genetically very close to Jews and other Middle East populations, including Turks (Anatolians), Lebanese, Egyptians, Armenians, and Iranians. Archaeologic and genetic data support that both Jews and Palestinians came from the ancient Canaanites, who extensively mixed with Egyptians, Mesopotamian, and Anatolian peoples in ancient times. Thus, Palestinian-Jewish rivalry is based in cultural and religious, but not in genetic, differences. The relatively close relatedness of both Jews and Palestinians to western Mediterranean populations reflects the continuous circum-Mediterranean cultural and gene flow that have occurred in prehistoric and historic times. This flow overtly contradicts the demic diffusion model of western Mediterranean populations substitution by agriculturalists coming from the Middle East in the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition.',\n",

       " {'abstract': \"Natural impacts in which the projectile strikes the target vertically are virtually nonexistent. Nevertheless, our inherent drive to simplify nature often causes us to suppose most impacts are nearly vertical. Recent theoretical, observational, and experimental work is improving this situation, but even with the current wealth of studies on impact cratering, the effect of impact angle on the final crater is not well understood. Although craters' rims may appear circular down to low impact angles, the distribution of ejecta around the crater is more sensitive to the angle of impact and currently serves as the best guide to obliquity of impacts. Experimental studies established that crater dimensions depend only on the vertical component of the impact velocity. The shock wave generated by the impact weakens with decreasing impact angle. As a result, melting and vaporization depend on impact angle; however, these processes do not seem to depend on the vertical component of the velocity alone. Finally, obliquity influences the fate of the projectile: in particular, the amount and velocity of ricochet are a strong function of impact angle.\",\n",

Using these modern methods, the pharmaceutical industry with strong academic and government collaboration has introduced in the last 25 years many new drugs that approach the ideal. After reviewing Björnsson's classification of drug action and the notion of contributory causality, this commentary defines an ideal drug from the perspectives of pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutics. Examples of new drugs for hypertension, heart disease, stroke, osteoporosis, asthma, ulcer, and migraine headaches are described. Finally, the profound implications of progress in developing ideal drugs not only for the patient but also for the academic, educational, and regulatory establishments are briefly reviewed.\",\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Marfan syndrome (MFS), an autosomal dominant disorder of the extracellular matrix, is due to mutations in fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene. Investigations carried out in the last decade, unveiled the unpredictability of the site of the mutation, which could be anywhere in the gene. FBN1 mutations have been reported in a spectrum of diseases related to MFS, with no clear evidence for a phenotype-genotype correlation. In this paper we analysed 10 British patients affected by MFS and we were able to characterise five novel missense mutations (C474W, C1402Y, G1987R, C2153Y, G2536R), one novel frameshift mutation (7926delC), one already described mutation (P1424A) and one FBN1 variant (P1148A) classified as a polymorphism in the Asian population. Four out of the five novel missense mutations involved either cysteines or an amino acid conserved in the domain structure. The mutation yield in this study is calculated at 80.0% (8/10), thus indicating that SSCA is a reliable and cost-effective technique for the screening of such a large gene. Our results suggest that this method is reliable to search for FBN1 mutations and that FBN1 screening could be a helpful tool to confirm and possibly anticipate the clinical diagnosis in familial cases.',\n",

       " {'abstract': \"The Phase 1 research program was unprecedented in its scope and ambitious in its objectives. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration committed to conducting a multidisciplinary long-duration research program on a platform whose capabilities were not well known, not to mention belonging to another country. For the United States, it provided the first opportunity to conduct research in a long-duration space flight environment since the Skylab program in the 1970's. Multiple technical as well as cultural challenges were successfully overcome through the dedicated efforts of a relatively small cadre of individuals. The program developed processes to successfully plan, train for and execute research in a long-duration environment, with significant differences identified from short-duration space flight science operations. Between August 1994 and June 1998, thousands of kilograms of research hardware was prepared and launched to Mir, and thousands of kilograms of hardware and data products were returned to Earth. More than 150 Principal Investigators from eight countries were involved in the program in seven major research disciplines: Advanced Technology; Earth Sciences; Fundamental Biology; Human Life Sciences; International Space Station Risk Mitigation; Microgravity; and Space Sciences. Approximately 75 long-duration investigations were completed on Mir, with additional investigations performed on the Shuttle flights that docked with Mir. The flight phase included the participation of seven US astronauts and 20 Russian cosmonauts. The successful completion of the Phase 1 research program not only resulted in high quality science return but also in numerous lessons learned to make the ISS experience more productive. The cooperation developed during the program was instrumental in its success.\",\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Recent studies on the structural composition of mammalian sperm heads have shown a congregate of unidentified proteins occupying the periphery of the mammalian sperm nucleus, forming a layer of condensed cytosol. These proteins are the perinuclear theca (PT) and can be categorized into SDS-soluble and SDS-insoluble components. The present study focused on identifying the major SDS-insoluble PT protein, which we localized to the subacrosomal layer of bovine spermatozoa and cloned by immunoscreening a bull testicular cDNA library. The isolated clones encode a protein of 122 amino acids that bears 67% similarity with histone H2B and contains a predicted histone fold motif. The novel amino terminus of the protein contains a potential bipartite nuclear targeting sequence. Hence, we identified this prominent subacrosomal component as a novel H2B variant, SubH2Bv. Northern blot analyses of SubH2Bv mRNA expression showed that it is testis-specific and is also present in murid testes. Immunocytochemical analysis showed SubH2Bv intimately associates, temporally and spatially, with acrosome formation. While the molecular features of SubH2Bv are common to nuclear proteins, it is never seen developmentally within the nucleus of the spermatid. Considering its developmental and molecular characteristics, we have postulated roles of SubH2Bv in acrosome assembly and acrosome-nuclear docking.',\n",

This article presents recipes of products made from sweet potato and determines the consumer acceptability of products containing from 6% to 20% sweet potato on a dry weight basis. These products were developed for use in nutritious and palatable meals for future space explorers. Sensory evaluation (appearance/color, aroma, texture, flavor/taste, and overall acceptability) studies were conducted to determine the consumer acceptability of vegetarian products made with sweet potato using panelists at NASA/Johnson Space Center in Houston, TX. None of these products including the controls, contained any ingredient of animal origin with the exception of sweet potato pie. A 9-point hedonic scale (9 being like extremely and 1 being dislike extremely) was used to evaluate 10 products and compare them to similar commercially available products used as controls. The products tested were pancakes, waffles, tortillas, bread, pie, pound cake, pasta, vegetable patties, doughnuts, and pretzels. All of the products were either liked moderately or liked slightly with the exception of the sweet potato vegetable patties, which were neither liked nor disliked. Mean comparisons of sensory scores of sweet potato recipes and their controls were accomplished by using the Student t-test. Because of their nutritional adequacy and consumer acceptability, these products are being recommended to NASA's Advanced Life Support Program for inclusion in a vegetarian menu plan designed for lunar/Mars space missions.\",\n",

In addition to the usual forward contamination procedures for the adequate protection of Mars for the sake of future missions, there are reasons to ensure that the sample is not contaminated by terrestrial microbes from the acquisition mission. Recent recommendations by the Space Studies Board (SSB) of the National Research Council (United States), would indicate that the scientific integrity of the sample is a planetary protection concern (SSB, 1997). Also, as a practical matter, a contaminated sample would interfere with the process for its release from quarantine after return for distribution to the interested scientists. These matters are discussed in terms of the first planned acquisition mission.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The recruitment of FtsZ to the septum and its subsequent interaction with other cell division proteins in a spatially and temporally controlled manner are the keys to bacterial cell division. In the present study, we have tested the hypothesis that FtsZ and FtsW of Mycobacterium tuberculosis could be binding partners. Using gel renaturation, pull-down, and solid-phase assays, we confirm that FtsZ and FtsW interact through their C-terminal tails, which carry extensions absent in their Escherichia coli counterparts. Crucial to these interactions is the cluster of aspartate residues Asp(367) to Asp(370) of FtsZ, which most likely interact with a cluster of positively charged residues in the C-terminal tail of FtsW. Mutations of the aspartate residues 367-370 showed that changing three aspartate residues to alanine resulted in complete loss of interaction. This is the first demonstration of the direct interaction between FtsZ and FtsW. We speculate that this interaction between FtsZ and FtsW could serve to anchor FtsZ to the membrane and link septum formation to peptidoglycan synthesis in M. tuberculosis. The findings assume particular significance in view of the global efforts to explore new targets in M. tuberculosis for chemotherapeutic intervention.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The regulation of SNARE complex assembly likely plays an important role in governing the specificity as well as the timing of membrane fusion. Here we identify a novel brain-enriched protein, amisyn, with a tomosyn- and VAMP-like coiled-coil-forming domain that binds specifically to syntaxin 1a and syntaxin 4 both in vitro and in vivo, as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation from rat brain. Amisyn is mostly cytosolic, but a fraction co-sediments with membranes. The amisyn coil domain can form SNARE complexes of greater thermostability than can VAMP2 with syntaxin 1a and SNAP-25 in vitro, but it lacks a transmembrane anchor and so cannot act as a v-SNARE in this complex. The amisyn coil domain prevents the SNAP-25 C-terminally mediated rescue of botulinum neurotoxin E inhibition of norepinephrine exocytosis in permeabilized PC12 cells to a greater extent than it prevents the regular exocytosis of these vesicles. We propose that amisyn forms nonfusogenic complexes with syntaxin 1a and SNAP-25, holding them in a conformation ready for VAMP2 to replace it to mediate the membrane fusion event, thereby contributing to the regulation of SNARE complex formation.',\n",

Various intelligent planning systems have been developed within the framework of artificial intelligence. These planning systems generally lack a rigorous mathematical formalism to allow a reliable and flexible methodology for their design, modeling, and performance analysis in a dynamical, time-critical, and multiconstrained environment. Formulating the planning problem in the domain of discrete-event systems under a unified framework such that it can be modeled, designed, and analyzed as a control system will provide a self-contained theory for such planning systems. This will also provide a means to certify various planning systems for operations in the dynamical and complex environments in space. The work presented here completes the design, development, and analysis of an intricate, large-scale, and representative mathematical formulation for intelligent control of a real planning system for Space Station crew training.

The present commentary responds to several of their claims. It explains why an analogy between kidneys and blood fails; why, as a matter of public policy, we prohibit the sale of human solid organs, yet allow the sale of blood; and why their attack on Kant\\'s putative argument against the sale of human body parts is misplaced. Finally, it rejects the claim that the state is entitled to interfere with the actions of individuals only if such actions would harm others. We draw certain lines grounded in what Rawls has termed \"public reason\" beyond which we do not give effect to the autonomous self-regarding decisions of individuals. Public resistance to the sale of human body parts, no matter how voluntary or well informed, is grounded in the conviction that such a practice would diminish human dignity and our sense of solidarity. A system of organ donation, in contrast, conveys our respect for persons and honors our common humanity.',\n",

He linked these tendencies both to the rise of capitalism and the growth of experimental science. The detailed case study of Paracelsus' account of diseases linked with saints, in common with his interpretation of many other conditions, demonstrates that he self-consciously extended the boundaries of medicine and eroded the role of magic and witchcraft associated with the church. On the other hand, Paracelsus adopted the Neoplatonic worldview, was immersed in popular magic, and evolved a system of medicine that self-consciously revolved around magic. These factors seem to place a distinct limit on his role in the demystification of knowledge. However, the magic of Paracelsus entailed a decisive break with the entrenched elitist and esoteric tradition of the occultists and hermeticists. It is argued that this reconstructed magic re-establishes the credentials of Paracelsus as a significant contributor to the disenchantment and secularization of the worldview.\",\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Several sigma receptor ligands have been reported to also have affinity for the dopamine transporter, among them rimcazole (9-[3-(cis-3,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)propyl]carbazole dihydrochloride). However, rimcazole lacks behavioral effects like those of other dopamine uptake inhibitors, such as cocaine and GBR 12909 (1-(2-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy]ethyl)-4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine dihydrochloride). Because of this profile, the interactions with cocaine of rimcazole and several of its novel analogues were assessed. The compounds studied were rimcazole, its N-methyl analogue, SH 1-73 (9-[3-(cis-3,5-dimethyl-4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-propyl]carbazole hydrobromide), the dibrominated analogue, SH 1-76 (3,6-dibromo-9-[3-(cis-3,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-propyl]carbazole hydrochloride), and the N-propylphenyl analogues, SH 3-24 ([3-(cis-3,5-dimethyl-4-[3-phenylpropyl]-1-piperazinyl)-propyl]diphenylamine hydrochloride) and SH 3-28 (9-[3-(cis-3,5-dimethyl-4-[3-phenylpropyl]-1-piperazinyl)-propyl]carbazole hydrobromide). The former has a diphenyl-amine group in place of the carbazole moiety of rimcazole, giving the compound additional structural similarity to GBR 12909. The rimcazole analogues produced dose-related decreases in locomotor activity, and also decreased cocaine-stimulated activity in mice. In rats trained to discriminate 10 mg/kg cocaine (i.p.) from saline injections, cocaine and GBR 12909 each produced a dose-related increase in cocaine-appropriate responding. Cocaine also increased rates of responding. SH 3-28 decreased cocaine-appropriate responding at the cocaine training dose to about 58% (SH 3-28) with two of five subjects selecting the cocaine response key. Neither rimcazole nor SH 3-24 produced a significant attenuation of the discriminative effects of cocaine. Rimcazole and its analogs all attenuated the increases in rates of responding produced by cocaine. In contrast to effects obtained with rimcazole analogs, GBR 12909 potentiated the cocaine-induced increases in locomotor activity and operant behavior, as well as the discriminative-stimulus effects of cocaine. The present results indicate that analogues of rimcazole can attenuate the behavioral effects of cocaine, and though the mechanism for these effects is not presently clear, it is possible that this attenuation maybe mediated by actions of the rimcazole analogues at the dopamine transporter and/or sigma receptors.',\n",

       " {'abstract': \"Mitochondrial Ca(2+) accumulation can induce a sudden increase in the permeability of the inner membrane. This phenomenon is due to the generation of a large nonselective ion channel, termed the permeability transition pore (PTP), which contributes to cellular injury during ischemia and reperfusion. Inhibition of PTP generation constitutes a relevant pharmacological target to protect a cell from death. In this study, we examined the effect of S-15176 ((N-[(3,5-di-tertiobutyl-4-hydroxy-1-thiophenyl)]-3-propyl-N'-(2,3,4-trimethoxybenzyl)piperazine), a novel anti-ischemic agent, on PTP in rat liver mitochondria. S-15176 prevented PTP opening generated by various triggering agents, as attested by the concentration-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial swelling, of mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation and of NADPH oxidation. These effects were associated with an increase in the Ca(2+) loading capacity of mitochondria. S-15176 was a strong inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, but experiments with another trimetazidine derivative devoid of antioxidant activity indicated that this activity was not essential to the inhibitory effect. Binding studies demonstrated that [3H]S-15176 bound to mitochondrial binding sites, especially those localized in the inner membrane. These sites were shared by several well-known inhibitors of PTP opening. These results demonstrate that the mechanism by which S-15176 protects mitochondria against the deleterious effects of ischemia-reperfusion involves inhibition of PTP opening and provide evidence that the drug operates through low structural specificity binding sites located in the inner mitochondrial membrane.\",\n",

The definition of refractory ascites has already been established, but using the dosage of diuretics that correlates with the definition of refractory ascites in an out-patient department will lower the compliance of the patient, as well as causing serious complications, such as hepatic encephalopathy and hyponatremia, as the dosage of diuretics is increased. Due to this fact, it is very difficult to apply this definition of refractory ascites to patients in a domestic out-patient department. In this study, in situations where there are difficulties in applying the diuretics dosage according to definition of refractory ascites, we tried to find out whether measuring the value of urine sodium after the administration of intravenous furosemide can be the standard in early differentiation of the response to diuretics treatment.',\n",

Given unaligned sequences of length L, these methods have O(L) time complexity. The ability of compressed amino acid alphabets to extend these techniques to distantly related proteins was investigated. The performance of these algorithms was evaluated for different alphabets and choices of k using a test set of 1848 pairs of structurally alignable sequences selected from the FSSP database. Distance measures derived from k-mer counting were found to correlate well with percentage identity derived from sequence alignments. Compressed alphabets were seen to improve performance in local similarity discovery, but no evidence was found of improvements when applied to distance estimates. The performance of our local similarity discovery method was compared with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) used in MAFFT, which has O(L log L) time complexity. The method for achieving comparable coverage to FFT is revealed here, and is more than an order of magnitude faster. We suggest using k-mer distance for fast, approximate phylogenetic tree construction, and show that a speed improvement of more than three orders of magnitude can be achieved relative to standard distance methods, which require alignments.',\n",

The cats were divided into two groups, sevoflurane group and halothane group, of eight subjects each. As parameters of the hypoxic ventilatory response, A value [the slope of the hyperbolic curve, V(E) = V(0) + A/(Pa(O)(2)-32)] and ratio of V(50) (the minute volume obtained from the hyperbolic equation when Pa(O)(2) = 50 mmHg) to V(0) were studied. These two parameters were examined at three states, sedative state with ketamine as the control, ketamine plus 0.1 MAC inhalation anesthetic, and ketamine plus 0.5 MAC inhalation anesthetic. In the sevoflurane group, the A values were 4789 +/- 1518, 2187 +/- 1214, 1730 +/- 880 (mean +/- SE. ml.min(-1).mmHg) at the control state, 0.1 MAC and 0.5 MAC, respectively. In the halothane group, the A values were 6411 +/- 2368, 2529 +/- 842 and 2372 +/- 545, respectively. The ratios of V(50) to V(0) were 1.32 +/- 0.09, 1.22 +/- 0.09, 1.25 +/- 0.08 in the sevoflurane group, 1.47 +/- 0.18, 1.32 +/- 0.11, 1.54 +/- 0.18 in the halothane group, respectively. The A value at 0.1 MAC of the halothane group was less than the control value significantly. This proved that even low concentration halothane depressed the hypoxic ventilatory responses. The depression of hypoxic ventilatory response could cause postanesthetic hypoventilation. On the other hand, we could not find significant depression on the hypoxic ventilatory response in the sevoflurane group, but we should notice that variances of the hypoxic ventilatory response were large.',\n",

A 60-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) 1 hour after being stung by a 12-cm centipede. He complained of right great toe pain that did not radiate to his leg. The patient had no known ischemic heart disease. He did not describe any exertional symptoms but admitted experiencing weakness. During the ED course, concurrent with obtaining peripheral intravenous access, the patient experienced diaphoresis, dizziness, hypotension, and bradycardia. His ECG showed new ST-T wave changes, which suggested an acute ischemic process. The patient's blood pressure was 89/60 mm Hg, his pulse rate was 47 beats/min, and his respiration rate was 28 breaths/min. In the following hours, ECG findings returned to baseline. His blood pressure improved gradually with fluid resuscitation after approximately 5 hours. Cardiac markers returned to normal in the 13th hour after the event, and the patient underwent exercise stress testing, which was negative. The patient was discharged with cardiology follow-up. Adult patients with centipede envenomation should be closely monitored in anticipation of possible myocardial ischemia due to vasospasm, hypotension, and myocardial toxic effects of the venom. A child receiving the same amount of venom would be potentially at greater risk.\",\n",

Prior to stress, the warm contact group underwent a 10-minute period of handholding while viewing a romantic video. Followed by a 20-second hug with their partner, while the no contact group rested quietly for 10 minutes and 20 seconds. In response to a public speaking task, individuals receiving prestress partner contact demonstrated lower systolic BP diastolic BP, and heart rate increases compared with the no contact group. The effects of warm contact were comparable for men and women and were greater for African Americans compared with Caucasians. These findings suggest that affectionate relationships with a supportive partner may contribute to lower reactivity to stressful life events and may partially mediate the benefit of marital support on better cardiovascular health.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Tubular structures created by precipitation abound in nature, from chimneys at hydrothermal vents to soda straws in caves. Their formation is controlled by chemical gradients within which precipitation occurs, defining a surface that templates the growing structure. We report a self-organized periodic templating mechanism producing tubular structures electrochemically in iron-ammonium-sulfate solutions; iron oxides precipitate on the surface of bubbles that linger at the tube rim and then detach, leaving behind a ring of material. The acid-base and redox gradients spontaneously generated by diffusion of ammonia from the bubble into solution organize radial compositional layering within the tube wall, a mechanism studied on a larger scale by complex Liesegang patterns of iron oxides formed as ammonia diffuses through a gel containing FeSO(4). When magnetite forms within the wall, a tube may grow curved in an external magnetic field. Connections with free-boundary problems in speleothem formation are emphasized.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Nerve growth factor receptor TrkA is critical for development and maturation of central and peripheral nervous systems, regulating proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. In cancer, TrkA frequently exhibits suppressor activity in nonmutated form and oncogenic activity upon mutation. Our identification of a novel hypoxia-regulated alternative TrkAIII splice variant, expressed by neural crest-derived neuroblastic tumors, that exhibits neuroblastoma tumor promoting activity, adds significantly to our understanding of potential TrkA involvement in cancer. Our observation that hypoxia, which characterizes the tumor micro-environment, stimulates alternative TrkAIII splicing, provides a way by which TrkA tumor suppressing signals may convert to tumor promoting signals during progression and is consistent with conservation and pathological subversion by neural crest-derived neuroblastic tumors of a mechanism of potential physiological importance to normal neural stem/neural crest progenitors.',\n",

For further insight in this rare entity the outcome of 65 inv(3)/t(3;3) positive AML cases were examined with special emphasis o n patient a nd disease related factors at diagnosis. Survival data were available from 35 patients. A hematological CR was achieved in 16/35 patients (46%). Eight patients (50%) relapsed. The median duration of remission was 177 days. Probability of OS was 23% at 2 years. Advanced age and high initial WBC count were associated with shorter OS (p = 0.021 and p = 0.005, respectively). Loss of chromosome 7 was the most frequent additional aberration (n = 34; 52%), followed complex aberrant aberrations (n = 5). Cases with monosomy 7 or the presence of FLT3-length mutations (FLT3-LM)--detected in 13% of cases--were not associated with an even more inferior outcome. Allogeneic stem cell translplantation, performed in 12 cases, resulted in a probability of OS of 62% at 2 years. Our data (1) confirm that inv(3)/t(3;3) AML has a poor prognosis (2) show that age and initial WBC are risk factors for prognosis; (3) suggest that this group may benefit from allogeneic stem cell transplantation.',\n",

Although the paper has been written from the perspective of economics, the discipline of the two authors, it is also of relevance to researchers in other disciplines. It is argued that there is a need to ensure that, when considering measurement in this largely neglected area of research, sufficient thought is given to the relationships that are being examined or assessed. We argue further that any attempt at measurement in this area must take into account the historical backdrop and the complex nature of the relationships between these key variables.',\n",

The influence of three kinds of error on the protonation constants has been investigated: error from the strategy of minimization, random error, and error from uncertain estimates of group parameters. An analysis of variance of the log K(i), matrix was made for 7 identical titrations and 8 computational strategies, or of 7 identical titrations and 8 different options of group parameters to be refined. The influence of the standard potential E(0) of the glass-electrode cell on the systematic error in log K is greater than that of the acid concentration (L(0)) or the concentration of titrant used (H(T)). The ill-conditioned group parameters should be refined together with the common parameters (K(i)), otherwise the estimates of log K(i), are not accurate enough. Two ways of calibrating the glass electrode cell were compared. Internal calibration (performed during titration) was more accurate than external calibration done separately. Of the programs tested ESAB and ACBA are the most powerful because they permit refinement of group parameters and internal calibration. Citric acid was chosen as model substance.\",\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Neural activity leads to hemodynamic changes which can be detected by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The determination of blood flow changes in individual vessels is an important aspect of understanding these hemodynamic signals. Blood flow can be calculated from the measurements of vessel diameter and blood velocity. When using line-scan imaging, the movement of blood in the vessel leads to streaks in space-time images, where streak angle is a function of the blood velocity. A variety of methods have been proposed to determine blood velocity from such space-time image sequences. Of these, the Radon transform is relatively easy to implement and has fast data processing. However, the precision of the velocity measurements is dependent on the number of Radon transforms performed, which creates a trade-off between the processing speed and measurement precision. In addition, factors like image contrast, imaging depth, image acquisition speed, and movement artifacts especially in large mammals, can potentially lead to data acquisition that results in erroneous velocity measurements. Here we show that pre-processing the data with a Sobel filter and iterative application of Radon transforms address these issues and provide more accurate blood velocity measurements. Improved signal quality of the image as a result of Sobel filtering increases the accuracy and the iterative Radon transform offers both increased precision and an order of magnitude faster implementation of velocity measurements. This algorithm does not use a priori knowledge of angle information and therefore is sensitive to sudden changes in blood flow. It can be applied on any set of space-time images with red blood cell (RBC) streaks, commonly acquired through line-scan imaging or reconstructed from full-frame, time-lapse images of the vasculature.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Actin-based remodelling underlies spine structural changes occurring during synaptic plasticity, the process that constantly reshapes the circuitry of the adult brain in response to external stimuli, leading to learning and memory formation. A positive correlation exists between spine shape and synaptic strength and, consistently, abnormalities in spine number and morphology have been described in a number of neurological disorders. In the present study, we demonstrate that the actin-regulating protein, Eps8, is recruited to the spine head during chemically induced long-term potentiation in culture and that inhibition of its actin-capping activity impairs spine enlargement and plasticity. Accordingly, mice lacking Eps8 display immature spines, which are unable to undergo potentiation, and are impaired in cognitive functions. Additionally, we found that reduction in the levels of Eps8 occurs in brains of patients affected by autism compared to controls. Our data reveal the key role of Eps8 actin-capping activity in spine morphogenesis and plasticity and indicate that reductions in actin-capping proteins may characterize forms of intellectual disabilities associated with spine defects.',\n",

We present the endovascular treatment of a giant postnephrectomy arteriovenous fistula between the right renal pedicle and the residual renal vein in a 63-year-old man. The purpose of this case report is to demonstrate that the Amplatzer vascular plug (AVP) can be safely positioned to embolize even relatively large arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). Secondly, we illustrate that this occluder can even be introduced to the fistula via a transvenous catheter in cases where it is initially not possible to advance the deployment-catheter through a tortuous feeder artery. Migration of the vascular plug was ruled out at follow-up 4 months subsequently to the intervention. Thus, the Amplatzer vascular plug and the arteriovenous through-and-through guide wire access with subsequent transvenous deployment should be considered in similar cases.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Xanthium spinosum L. (Asteraceae) is a medicinal weed distributed worldwide. Many of its diverse ethnopharmacological uses - namely diarrhoea, inflammation, liver disorders, snake bite and fever - are linked - at least in part - to an uncontrolled release of arachidonic acid metabolites. The crude extract of X. spinosum roots from Jordanian origin dose-dependently inhibited the 5-LOX (IC50 is approximately equal to 10 μg/mL), COX-1(IC50 is approximately equal to 50 μg/mL), and 12-LOX (IC50 is approximately equal to 170 μg/mL) enzymatic pathways in intact pro-inflammatory cells. A direct activity at the level of PLA2 is not probable, but the extract induced the synthesis of the anti-inflammatory eicosanoid 15(S)-HETE, which may in turn inhibit this enzyme. 5-LOX bioguided fractionation of the crude extract led to the isolation of ziniolide, a known 12,8-guaianolide sesquiterpene lactone, from the hydro-alcoholic fraction of the n-hexane extract (IC50=69 μM). Both the plant extract and ziniolide are in vitro inhibitors of the phorbol-induced NFκB activation, a key regulator of the arachidonic pathway.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Rapid effects of social interactions on transient changes in hormonal levels are known in a wide variety of vertebrate taxa, ranging from fish to humans. Although these responses are mediated by the brain, neurochemical pathways that translate social signals into reproductive physiological changes are unclear. In this study, we analyzed how a female presence modifies synthesis and/or release of various neurochemicals, such as monoamines and neuropeptides, in the brain and downstream reproductive hormones in sexually active male Japanese quail. By viewing a female bird, sexually active males rapidly increased norepinephrine (NE) release in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, in which gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) neuronal cell bodies exist, increased GnIH precursor mRNA expression in the PVN, and decreased luteinizing hormone (LH) concentration in the plasma. GnIH is a hypothalamic neuropeptide that inhibits gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary. It was further shown that GnIH can rapidly suppress LH release after intravenous administration in this study. Centrally administered NE decreased plasma LH concentration in vivo. It was also shown that NE stimulated the release of GnIH from diencephalic tissue blocks in vitro. Fluorescence double-label immunohistochemistry indicated that GnIH neurons received noradrenergic innervations, and immunohistochemistry combined with in situ hybridization have further shown that GnIH neurons expressed α2A-adrenergic receptor mRNA. These results indicate that a female presence increases NE release in the PVN and stimulates GnIH release, resulting in the suppression of LH release in sexually active male quail.',\n",

Aberrant radial spoke components RSPH1, 3, 4a and 9 have been linked with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by ciliary dysmotility; yet, radial spoke functions remain unclear. Here we show that zebrafish Rsph9 is expressed in cells bearing motile cilia and kinocilia, and localizes to both 9\\u2009+\\u20092 and 9\\u2009+\\u20090 ciliary axonemes.

       " {'abstract': 'SAR11 is a group of small, carbon-oxidizing cells that reach a global estimated population size of 2.4 × 1028 cells-approximately 25% of all plankton. They are found throughout the oceans but reach their largest numbers in stratified, oligotrophic gyres, which are an expanding habitat in the warming oceans. SAR11 likely had a Precambrian origin and, over geological time, evolved into the niche of harvesting labile, low-molecular-weight dissolved organic matter (DOM). SAR11 cells are minimal in size and complexity, a phenomenon known as streamlining that is thought to benefit them by lowering the material costs of replication and maximizing transport functions that are essential to competition at ultralow nutrient concentrations. One of the surprises in SAR11 metabolism is their ability to both oxidize and produce a variety of volatile organic compounds that can diffuse into the atmosphere. SAR11 cells divide slowly and lack many forms of regulation commonly used by bacterial cells to adjust to changing environmental conditions. As a result of genome reduction, they require an unusual range of nutrients, which leads to complex biochemical interactions with other plankton. The study of SAR11 is providing insight into the biogeochemistry of labile DOM and is affecting microbiology beyond marine science by providing a model for understanding the evolution and function of streamlined cells. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Marine Science Volume 9 is January 03, 2017. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'Assembly of synthetic genetic circuits is central to synthetic biology. Yeast S. cerevisiae, in particular, has proven to be an ideal chassis for synthetic genome assemblies by exploiting its efficient homologous recombination. However, this property of efficient homologous recombination poses a problem for multigene assemblies in yeast, since repeated usage of standard parts, such as transcriptional terminators, can lead to rearrangements of the repeats in assembled DNA constructs in vivo. To address this issue in developing a library of orthogonal genetic components for yeast, we designed a set of short synthetic terminators based on a consensus sequence with random linkers to avoid repetitive sequences. We constructed a series of expression vectors with these synthetic terminators for efficient assembly of synthetic genes using Gateway recombination reactions. We also constructed two BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) vectors for assembling multiple transcription units with the synthetic terminators in vitro and their integration in the yeast genome. The tandem array of synthetic genes integrated in the genome by this method is highly stable because there are few homologous segments in the synthetic constructs. Using this system of assembly and genomic integration of transcription units, we tested the synthetic terminators and their influence on the proximal transcription units. Although all the synthetic terminators have the common consensus with the identical length, they showed different activities and impacts on the neighboring transcription units.',\n",

       " {'abstract': 'The effectiveness of passive immunisation post-exposure to measles appears subject to a dose-response effect. New Zealand and the United Kingdom have increased the recommended dose of polyclonal human immunoglobulin for post-exposure prophylaxis within the last decade in response to concerns about decreasing levels of measles antibodies in these products. This study used the plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) to measure the titre of measles-specific antibodies in Australian immunoglobulin products for post-exposure prophylaxis and compared the utility of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to the PRNT in available Australian and international samples: Australian intramuscular (n = 10), Australian intravenous (n = 28), New Zealand intramuscular (n = 2), Hizentra (subcutaneous)(USA) (n = 3), and Privigen (intravenous)(USA) (n = 2). Measles titres in Australian IM and IV immunoglobulins ranged from 51 to 76\\xa0IU/mL and 6 to 24\\xa0IU/mL respectively, as measured by PRNT calibrated to the WHO 3rd international standard. ELISA titres were variable but higher than PRNT titres in all tested samples. Measles antibody titres in Australian immunoglobulin products meet consensus-prescribed international thresholds. Development of a convenient, standardized, readily accessible assay for determination of measles titres in immunoglobulin products would be useful for future studies and facilitate international comparisons.',\n",
